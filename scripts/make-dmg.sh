# Builds Halo Helper and packs it into build/HaloHelper.dmg: the app next to a shortcut to
# Applications, so you can drag it across. That's the file a GitHub release carries; install.sh
# downloads it from there.
#
#   --sign         sign the app and the disk image with Developer ID, without notarizing
#   --notarize     sign with Developer ID, have Apple notarize it and staple the ticket, so macOS opens it
#                  without a malware warning, even when downloaded in a browser. Needs a one-time
#                  `xcrun notarytool store-credentials halo-notary` (see the README, "Making a release").
#   --skip-build   pack the app already in build/
